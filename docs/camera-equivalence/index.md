# Two cameras as equivalent evidence on one canvas

## World

Observers (cameras) sit at unknown poses $T_k$ in a world frame $W$ and observe features $X_j$ with unknown intrinsics $\pi_k$:

$$x_{kj} = \pi_k\!\left(T_k^{-1} X_j\right)$$

The two cameras are the same kind of observer. They differ only in $T_k$ and $\pi_k$.

## Model

One shared hidden canvas $h$. Each camera $k$ has its own learned readout:

$$\hat{x}_k = g_k(h), \qquad e_k = x_k - \hat{x}_k$$

The canvas is corrected by the errors of every enabled camera at once. Cameras differ only through $g_k$ (pose and intrinsics are absorbed into it). No geometry is assumed.

## Phase 1 (multi-device agent)

- A second readout branch for camera 2 over the same canvas.
- Cover camera 1 and camera 2 still corrects the canvas.
- No coupling between branches; no homography.

## Phase 2: visualize correspondences

No transform is fitted for now. Once both cameras project onto the canvas, the correspondence should show itself there. Phase 2 only makes it visible:

1. Show each camera's prediction $g_k(h)$ and error $e_k$ next to the canvas.
2. Show the underlying mappings: for a selected hidden unit $i$, its receptive field in each camera (from $g_k$).
3. Show which canvas regions both cameras excite.

Fitting $H$ (DLT with RANSAC on receptive-field centroids $c_i^{(k)}$) is deferred until the visualization shows whether a homography is a sensible description.

## Open questions

- A homography is exact only for planar or distant scenes. What is the next transform (epipolar / fundamental matrix, depth-dependent warp, learned flow)?
- EO and IR are not a matched pair. Do shared units emerge at all without cross-modal supervision?
- Should the checkerboard calibration be an independent baseline?
- Where does the visualization show up in the TUI: tile, overlay or log?
