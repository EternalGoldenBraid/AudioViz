# Audio Ripple

**Audio Ripple** is an immersive audio-reactive visualizer designed for live performance, interactive installations, and creative experimentation. It transforms sound into dynamic ripple waves that animate a 2D plane, offering a perceptually compelling visual feedback loop between the sonic and the spatial.

## 🌊 What is Audio Ripple?

Audio Ripple generates a simulated wave propagation field in response to real-time audio input. Microphone signals are translated into visual energy ripples using a finite difference approximation of the 2D wave equation. It enables:

* Audio-driven ripple simulations
* Real-time visual feedback for musical or spoken input
* Projected visuals in installations and performances
* A canvas for future multimodal interactions (e.g., dance, pose-tracking)

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time wave propagation visualized on a 2D surface
- Flexible audio input: default is microphone via `sounddevice`, but any input device can be configured
- Optional synthetic tone generator for testing
- Optional GPU acceleration (via CuPy); CPU wave propagation is the default
- Adjustable wave physics: damping, decay, speed, amplitude
- Modular audio processor and visualizer structure

## 🔧 Installation

If `pixi.sh` install from `pyproject.toml`
```bash
pixi update
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt (get from `pyproject.toml`)
```
```
python main.py
```

Adjust runtime settings in `main.py`, including resolution, plane size, and optional GPU usage.

## 🧍 Pose Model

The pose graph demo expects a local MediaPipe Pose Landmarker `.task` model when
the installed MediaPipe version uses the Tasks API. Use the Lite bundle as the
mobile-friendly default:

```bash
mkdir -p models
curl -L -o models/pose_landmarker_lite.task https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/pose_landmarker/pose_landmarker_lite/float16/latest/pose_landmarker_lite.task
```

Run the camera demo with the optional pose dependencies:

```bash
uv run --group pose-demo python scripts/pose_graph_demo.py --model-path models/pose_landmarker_lite.task
```

The downloaded `.task` bundle is ignored by git.

## 🎛️ Interactive Controls

Accessible from GUI sliders:

* **Damping**: Controls wave attenuation over time (physical energy loss)
* **Decay α**: Sets spatial spread of excitation; higher values make sources more localized
* **Amplitude**: Controls excitation strength
* **Speed**: Wave propagation speed in meters per second

## ✨ Vision

This project is meant to be more than a tool—it's a medium. Imagine walking into an empty room where every footstep sends waves across a projected canvas. Every voice becomes a living waveform, every interaction ripples outward. The future includes:

* Using video/pose tracking (e.g., OpenPose) to trigger ripples from body motion
* Modeling crowd dynamics through ripple fields

> *The machine is just a medium through which waves travel between us.*

## 🌱 Inspiration

* Physical wave propagation dynamics
* Shared embodiment and resonance in human movement and sound
* Experiences of synesthesia
